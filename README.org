* A modern-looking, multi-purpose neovim configuration

- modular: add and configure plugins in separate files, then source them to a central init.vim file
- multi-purpose: use it for writing in science and engineering with markdown, pandoc, and LaTeX, or for coding in python
- one build, diverse realizations everywhere: enjoy consistent performance in the commandline, in a packaged GUI such as [[https://github.com/qvacua/vimr][vimR]], or in [[https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim][VS Code]]!
- modern-looking:

* Setup

- install [[https://neovim.io][neovim]]
- clone this folder to a convenient location on your computer, e.g., ~/Downloads/nvim
- backup your original nvim settings, e.g., in commandline with
  #+begin_src shell
  mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim-bk
  #+end_src
- move this folder to your vim setting folder, e.g.,
    #+begin_src shell
    mv ~/Downloads/nvim ~/.config/nvim
    #+end_src
- To sync setting on multiple computers, store the folder in a network drive and symbolically link the folder to your vim setting folder.
