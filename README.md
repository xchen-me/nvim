# A modern-looking, multi-purpose neovim configuration
* modular: add and configure plugins in separate files, then source them to a central init.vim file
* multi-purpose: use it for writing in science and engineering with markdown, pandoc, and LaTeX, or for coding in python
* one build, diverse realizations everywhere: enjoy consistent performance in the commandline, in a packaged GUI such as [vimR](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr), or in [VS Code](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim)!
* modern-looking: 

# Setup
* install [neovim](https://neovim.io)
* To use the same setting on multiple computers, store the folder in a network drive and symbolically link the folder to your vim setting folder (~/.config/nvim directory on a Mac).
